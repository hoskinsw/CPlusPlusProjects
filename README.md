# CPlusPlusProjects
Various C and C++ sample projects

This is a project I am making to practice various C and C++ libraries, coding problems, and versions.

Some examples of what will be in this eventually:

OpenGL, DirectX 11 (maybe 12 if I have time), Threading, Coding Problems (HackerRank and LeetCode for now), Differences in various versions of C++, Examples from the C++ class I am currently teaching

This will all be made based on what I am feeling like working on at the time, I will try to make a timeline and update this as things are uploaded
